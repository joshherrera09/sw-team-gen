## Description
I built a software engineering team generator command line apllication that uses Node.js.  The application prompts the user for information about their team manager, engineers, and interns.  When the user has finished building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays the team roster, based on the information provided by the user.

## Installation
To begin setting up your development environment, you must first run `npm init` in the terminal, to set up a new npm package.  Once npm has been initialized, you must also run `npm i inquirer` in the terminal to install inquirer, which will allow the user to ask and validate questions to help generate the their teams HTML file.

## Usage

[Generated Page Example](https://github.com/joshherrera09/sw-team-gen/blob/master/functioning-app.mov)

After initializing npm and installing Inquirer, the user must run `node app.js` in the terminal.  The user will be prompted with a series of questions that should be answered in relation to your team.  After completing the questions, the team.html will automatically be generated.
